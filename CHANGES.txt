v0.91 [2014-07-18]
- added usage info to some sprites on the sprite editor
  (currently only for warp stars, cannons, and switches; maybe more in the future)
- fixed two minor UI bugs with the tileset editor
  (subtract from tile # box works correctly now)
- removed a limitation in the game where all of screen 15 (and part of screen 14)
  had no collision due to the tile collison detection code refusing to read that far
  into the currently loaded map data for some reason
  (thanks to CornetTheory for finding this issue)

v0.90 [2014-06-12]
- new HTML documentation
- full tileset, BG palette, and sprite palette editing
- editing of "stage clear" and star switch reveal areas on overworlds
- some text changes ("level" replaced with "room" or "stage" when appropriate)
- allow pasting beyond 64 tiles in either direction; this was a limitation that managed
  to survive being copied from KDCEditor without being updated for the real maximum
  height/width of Kirby's Adventure maps (thanks DarkMatt)
- more new icons (by Reimu)
- sprites and exits outside of level bounds are no longer shown, saved, or editable
- tile edit window displays tile numbers in hex
- opening non-Kirby's Adventure ROMs now displays an error instead of continuing

v0.83b [2014-04-19]
- only write some tileset info for ingame tilesets, not every single one.
  this was causing crashes as of v0.83 (thanks again J^P)
  once again, this update will automatically repair any ROM damage caused by v0.83

v0.83 [2014-04-18]
- fixed the limit on # of exits being too high, easily leading to corruption
  (due to some incorrect info on datacrystal)
  this was capable of affecting boss battle info (for the "next world" doors) which
  can now be edited as part of the normal exit data, as well as part of the tileset
  data, which the editor will now repair automatically until the actual tileset editor
  is added (soon, hopefully.)
- added the ability to change boss battle locations when editing a door with type 0x1F
  (the "next" overworld doors)
- fixed a bug where the music track and "no return on death" settings in the level
  properties dialog didn't take effect unless other settings were also changed
  (thanks J^P)
- new "edit exits" and "level properties" menu/window icons (made by Reimu)

v0.82 [2014-03-29]
- fixed double size mode leaving sprites/exits in the wrong place
  (thanks Darkdata)

v0.81 [2014-03-26]
- fixed saved sprite data occasionally being incorrect
- fixed some sprite positions being wrong when a level was more than one screen tall
  (due to the game treating sprite position data as if screens were 16 tiles tall,
   instead of the usual 12)
  (thanks to Reimu for pointing out both of the above)
- destroyable block translucency now affects more types when enabled
  
v0.80 [2014-03-20]
- initial release
